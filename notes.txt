Frameworks:
  Express - node js framework for doing web apps
    runs on node, does what we've done, but pulling in more libraries.
    comes with https built in. Still writing js, still running on node.
    Might not be as fully featured as could be wished.
    Node is already on my computer!
  Rails - Ruby, does probably more than express. Comes with a lot more ways
    to make things cleaner. Good community support
  Elixir & Phoenix - His favorite
